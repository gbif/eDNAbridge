Description: This R package provides functions to facilitate the transformation of environmental DNA (eDNA) occurrence data into the Darwin Core Archive (DwC-A) format and publishing via the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT). It is aimed to be an end-to-end workflow primarily focused for holders of eDNA data looking for more automated solutions to publishing eDNA data to GBIF.
